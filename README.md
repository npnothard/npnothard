## ü¶ñ About Me

Hello, this is Yuchen Yang, a Ph.D. student at Nanjing University. 
My research lies at the intersection of algorithmic theory and system-level optimization for elastic, time-efficient distributed computing. 
In particular, I design, analyze, and implement scheduling algorithms and systems for edge and on-device computing environments to support both general-purpose and AI workloads. 
My current interests focus on accelerating distributed LLM systems, with an emphasis on on-device Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) serving.

## ‚öΩ Miscellaneous
I have a wide range of hobbies, spanning from sports to arts. 
I am particularly passionate about soccer: I served as the captain of the soccer team at the School of Physics, HUST, and was fortunate to play alongside a group of passionate and cohesive teammates. 
Together, we won a championship in 2019 and secured two runner-up finishes in 2021 and 2022‚Äîthe only season we didn‚Äôt finish in the top two was due to the pandemic.

Beyond sports, I have a deep interest in music, especially Soviet Army songs, Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish folk music, as well as Cossack-style tunes.
Here's a list of my personal recommendations:
