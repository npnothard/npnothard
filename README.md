## ðŸ¦– About Me

Hello, this is Yurchenko, a Ph.D. student at Nanjing University.
My research focuses on algorithm design and system implementation towards efficient distributed computing. In particular, I design, analyze, and implement online scheduling algorithms and systems tailored for edge and serverless environments to support both general-purpose and AI workloads. I am also interested in accelerating distributed machine learning systems, with a current focus on on-device Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) serving.
