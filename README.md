## ðŸ¦– About Me

Hello, this is Yurchenko, a Ph.D. student at Nanjing University.
My research focuses on algorithmic theory and system-level optimization towards elastic and time-efficient distributed computing. 
In particular, I design, analyze, and implement scheduling algorithms and systems tailored for edge and on-device environments to support both general-purpose and AI workloads. 
Currently, I am interested in accelerating distributed LLM systems, with a focus on on-device Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) serving.
