## ðŸ¦– About Me

Hello, Iâ€™m Yurchenko, a Ph.D. student at Nanjing University, where I am unfortunate enough to be adviced by Prof. Shaowei Wang. 
My research lies at the intersection of algorithmic theory and system-level optimization for elastic, time-efficient distributed computing. 
In particular, I design, analyze, and implement scheduling algorithms and systems for edge and on-device environments, supporting both general-purpose and AI workloads. 
My current interests focus on accelerating distributed LLM systems, with an emphasis on on-device Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) serving.
